Issues found or introduced by porting all persistence to Spring Data and LocalStorage

Found:
-CartListMenu for sending commands to devices may not be functional.
-In CartManagementScreen delete unit is not operational, we should implement:
  User press Delete > Confirm dialog with checkbox "Delete cart" and "Delete unit".
-SmsApiSettingsPanel is not in use
-AtacServiceThread is not in use. Needs to be moved to the server side.

Removed PredefinedMessageDialog, needs to be reimplemented to send:
    WEATHER_ALERT_ENABLE, WEATHER_ALERT_DISABLE //"Enable Weather Alert"
    CARTPATH_ONLY_ENABLE, CARTPATH_ONLY_DISABLE //"Enable Cart Path Only"
    DISABLE_CARTKILL, ENABLE_CARTKILL //"Enable Accessible Mode"
    In CartPacePanel:204, a setting should toggle these commands

-Removed Courses.defaultTees
-Create admin user not working
-Should login using localStorage credentials
-Need to finish Screen impl and saving in GolfCourseSetupScreen

-CrudRepository.save doesn't play well with CourseInfo because our id is 0
